    <h1>🥐 Croissant!</h1>
    <p>Croissants, those flaky, golden crescents of delight, have a captivating story that transcends borders and
        tantalizes
        taste buds. Originating in Vienna, Austria, these buttery pastries gained international fame when they made
        their way to
        France in the early 19th century. Their distinctive shape, reminiscent of a victorious Ottoman crescent,
        adds to
        their
        allure. But it’s not just their appearance that makes them special.
